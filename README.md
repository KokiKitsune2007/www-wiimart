WiiMart is a fan-made revival of the classic Wii Shop Channel, bringing back your favorite experience with a modern touch

i dediced to remake wiimart's original website because i was bored

just to clarify this isnt the official wiimart's website, its just my version that i coded independently 

github pages version is still messy, for now i recommend downloading it and opening on VSCode, then viewing the website via Live Server
